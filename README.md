 Title of Project: Local Tkinter App for Managing CSV Files on a Local Server

 Description:
This project involves developing a local desktop application using Python's Tkinter library. The application will connect to a local server to perform various operations on CSV files stored on the server. The functionalities include creating new CSV files, modifying existing ones, deleting files, and adjusting the contents of CSV files according to user requirements.

 Key Components:
1. Tkinter App: 
   - Design and implement a user-friendly interface for file management and interactions.
   - Main features: Creating, modifying, and deleting CSV files.
   - Additional features: Adjusting contents of CSV files (e.g., adding, updating, or removing rows/columns).

2. Local Server Communication:
   - Develop a simple local server using Flask to handle file operations requested by the Tkinter app.
   - Implement endpoints for file operations and data adjustments.

3. CSV File Management:
   - Implement functionalities to handle CSV file creation, modification, and deletion on the server.
   - Provide options to adjust the contents of CSV files.

4. Error Handling and Validation:
   - Ensure robust error handling and validation throughout the application for a seamless user experience.

 Timeline:
1. Week 1:
   - Kickoff meeting and task assignment.
   - Initial setup of the Tkinter app layout and Flask server.

2. Week 2-3:
   - Implementation of core functionalities (creating, modifying, deleting CSV files).
   - Development of server-side logic for handling CSV file operations.

3. Week 4:
   - Integration of the Tkinter app with the Flask server.
   - Initial testing and bug fixing.

4. Week 5:
   - Implementation of error handling and validation.
   - Comprehensive testing and validation.

5. Week 6:
   - Final documentation.
   - Review and feedback.
   - Project presentation and deployment.
This project aims to enhance our skills in developing desktop applications, working with local servers, and managing CSV files effectively. By dividing the workload and collaborating efficiently, we will ensure a successful project outcome.
